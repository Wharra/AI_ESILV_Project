# 📊 TelcoTrend: Analysis and Modeling of Technological Indicators

## 📘 Description

This project was carried out as part of a **Data Science course at ESILV**.
The objective is to explore, clean, and model global data on telephone and internet subscriptions in order to identify trends and make regional forecasts.

---

## 🧠 Methodology

The pipeline follows the main steps of the **Machine Learning workflow**:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – visualization of distributions and regional trends.
2. **Data Preparation** – handling missing values, normalization, and standardization.
3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** – dimensionality reduction to visualize data structure.
4. **Supervised Modeling**:

   * **SVR (Support Vector Regression)** for future value prediction.
   * **SVC (Support Vector Classification)** for regional classification.
   * Performance comparison before and after **hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)**.

## 🧩 Skills & Tools

* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Dimensionality reduction (PCA)
* Supervised learning (Regression & Classification)
* Model performance visualization and interpretation

---

## 💼 Relevance to Finance

The applied methods (**PCA, SVR, SVC**) are directly transferable to **quantitative finance** for:

* **Financial forecasting**
* **Market trend detection**
* **Portfolio segmentation and optimization**

These techniques form the basis of modern **quantitative and algorithmic trading models**.

Would you like me to slightly **rename “TelcoTrend”** to something more aligned with your **finance-oriented profile** (for example *QuantTrend* or *GlobalPredictor*) while keeping the same text?
